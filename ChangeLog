Changes since 0.5.2.0
=====================

* Shift overall analysis to the top and per-module analysis to the
  end, as suggested by Duncan Coutts.

* Graph drawing fixups: instances are now drawn correctly, and the
  module graph now has modules located in the correct directory.

* Improve some graph drawing aspects (node margins, colours for module
  graphs, etc.).

Changes since 0.5.1.0
=====================

* Add support for passing a single Haskell source file rather than a
  Cabal file as the argument, as requested by Curt Sampson.

* Shade backgrounds of modules when clustering Entities.

* RelativeNeighbourhood doesn't provide good alternate modules and
  takes up too much runtime, and so has been removed.

Changes since 0.5.0.0
=====================

* Re-write of parsing.

* Usage of new graphviz and Graphalyze features.

* More abstraction into common routines into Analyse.Utils
