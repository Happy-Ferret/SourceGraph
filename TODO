TODO for SourceGraph
====================

* Have a way of showing small graphs in the all-in-one file
  that then link to larger graphs.

* Let users choose output directory

* Let users choose output format

* Have a "just draw the graph" option

* "Smarter" analysis: don't show compressed if its boring, etc.

* Write a README
