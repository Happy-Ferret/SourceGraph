Can't parse/understand the following types items:

* Code that doesn't compile/type-check/etc.; haskell-src-exts won't understand
  them.

* Modules using CPP.

* HaRP usage.

* Template Haskell

* Haskell Source with XML/Haskell Server Pages-style embedded XML

* Data Family instances (both normal and GADT) don't have their
  constructors/records added as it isn't obvious how to go from the
  type to a name of the type.

* FFI imports/exports are ignored.

* Pragmas are ignored.

Possible parsing problems with the following items:

* Modules not within the given project; if an explicit import is used,
  then the entitys are guessed at (can't always categorise function
  types, etc.).

* When using record puns, it is not always possible to distinguish
  between the records and punned values.

* When using record wildcards, not all records are completely
  listed/used as both record functions and variables (see the problem
  with record puns above).

* When considering instances of a class, it doesn't deal well with
  multi-param type classes, etc. in that it assumes the first type
  mentioned is the type that the instance is for.  This is mainly for
  creating virtual functions for the instances.

* Language options specified in the Cabal file.

* If a datatype or class is re-exported from another module, then this
  won't be picked up.
