This is a list of known problems with SourceGraph except for those
related to parsing.

* Node-based reporting (cycles, etc.) get confused with Class
  functions.

* Printing of labels doesn't always turn out so well (overlaps, etc.).

* For some reason, a lot of class instance functions won't get drawn
  in their clusters like they're meant to.  Not sure why, as the
  generated Dot code looks right (this might be from a limitation of
  dot...).

* No options on what to do, etc.
